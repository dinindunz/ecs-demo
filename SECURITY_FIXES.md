# Security Compliance Remediation - SMP-21

## Overview
This document outlines the security fixes applied to the ecs-demo repository to address critical vulnerabilities identified during compliance evaluation against the Cutdown Compliance Guidelines.

## Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. Dependency Security (Compliance Guidelines 7.8)
**Issue**: Outdated dependencies with known security vulnerabilities
**Fix**: Updated all dependencies to secure versions:
- Flask 1.0.2 → 2.3.3 (addresses XSS and security vulnerabilities)
- Werkzeug 0.15.4 → 2.3.7 (critical security updates)
- Jinja2 2.10.1 → 3.1.2 (template injection fixes)
- PyYAML 3.13 → 6.0.1 (insecure loading fixes)
- All other dependencies updated to latest secure versions

### 2. SQL Injection Vulnerability
**Issue**: Login endpoint vulnerable to SQL injection attacks
**Fix**: Implemented parameterized queries using SQLite's parameter substitution

### 3. Command Injection Vulnerability
**Issue**: Ping endpoint allowed arbitrary command execution
**Fix**: Removed unsafe subprocess calls, disabled ping functionality

### 4. Insecure Deserialization
**Issue**: Use of pickle for file uploads allowing remote code execution
**Fix**: Replaced pickle with secure JSON deserialization with validation

### 5. Path Traversal Vulnerability
**Issue**: File reading endpoint allowed access to arbitrary system files
**Fix**: Disabled file reading functionality for security

### 6. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
**Issue**: Multiple endpoints vulnerable to XSS attacks
**Fix**: Implemented proper input validation and output escaping using Flask's escape function

### 7. Hardcoded Secrets
**Issue**: Secret keys and database credentials hardcoded in source code
**Fix**: Moved secrets to environment variables with secure defaults

### 8. Debug Mode in Production
**Issue**: Debug mode enabled exposing sensitive information
**Fix**: Debug mode now controlled by environment variable, disabled by default

### 9. Insecure YAML Loading
**Issue**: Use of unsafe YAML loader allowing code execution
**Fix**: Replaced with yaml.safe_load()

### 10. Docker Security Issues
**Issue**: Container running as root with hardcoded secrets
**Fix**: 
- Created non-root user for container execution
- Removed hardcoded environment variables
- Updated to Python 3.11 for security patches

## Security Best Practices Implemented

1. **Input Validation**: Added comprehensive input validation for all user inputs
2. **Output Encoding**: Proper escaping of all dynamic content
3. **Authentication**: Added session-based authentication checks
4. **Password Security**: Implemented password hashing using Werkzeug's security functions
5. **Error Handling**: Secure error handling without information disclosure
6. **Container Security**: Non-root user execution in Docker container

## Deployment Security Requirements

### Environment Variables Required:
- `SECRET_KEY`: Cryptographically secure secret key (minimum 32 bytes)
- `DATABASE_URL`: Database connection string (if using external database)
- `FLASK_ENV`: Set to 'production' for production deployments

### Recommended Additional Security Measures:
1. Implement HTTPS/TLS encryption
2. Add rate limiting for API endpoints
3. Implement CSRF protection
4. Add security headers (HSTS, CSP, etc.)
5. Regular security scanning and dependency updates
6. Implement proper logging and monitoring
7. Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF)

## Testing
Before deployment, ensure:
1. All dependencies install correctly
2. Application starts without errors
3. Authentication functionality works
4. No debug information is exposed
5. Input validation is working correctly

## Compliance Status
✅ **COMPLIANT** - All critical security vulnerabilities have been addressed according to the Cutdown Compliance Guidelines section 7.8.

## Next Steps
1. Deploy to staging environment for testing
2. Conduct security testing/penetration testing
3. Implement additional security measures as recommended
4. Schedule regular security reviews and dependency updates
